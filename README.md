# Odin Project - Full-Stack Web Development Journey

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm currently learning full-stack web development through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/),  an amazing open-source curriculum.

## What I've Learned So Far ðŸ“š

âœ… **Version Control with Git and GitHub**  
I've learned the basics of Git, including how to use it for version control, create repositories, commit changes, and collaborate using GitHub.

âœ… **HTML Fundamentals**  
I've started my journey by learning HTML, understanding the structure of web pages, semantic tags, and how to properly organize content on the web.

## What's Next? ðŸ”œ
As I progress through The Odin Project curriculum, I'll be diving into:
- CSS for styling web pages
- JavaScript for interactivity
- Backend development with Node.js
- And more!

## Feel Free to Follow Along ðŸš€
If you're also learning web development or interested in seeing how I progress, feel free to check back often as I update this repository regularly.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
